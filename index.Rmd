# Mia's coffee orders over time

Mia loves her coffee. These are her favourite things to order: `r orders`

It all started on `r month_1` `r day_1`, `r year_1` in `r location_1` with a `r order_1` coffee.

She loves them so much that she has had `r top_cof` coffee `r top_times` times!


### Look at all the coffee she drinks!
